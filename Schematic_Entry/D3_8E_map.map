Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                     0 out of  93,120    0%
  Number of Slice LUTs:                          8 out of  46,560    1%
    Number used as logic:                        8 out of  46,560    1%
      Number using O6 output only:               8
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                    0
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  16,720    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     6 out of  11,640    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:            8
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             8 out of       8  100%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of       8    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           0 out of       8    0%
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  93,120    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
