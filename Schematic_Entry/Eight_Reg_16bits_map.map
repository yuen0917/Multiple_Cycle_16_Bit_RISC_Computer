      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                    0
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  16,720    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   125 out of  11,640    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          288
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           160 out of     288   55%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  56 out of     288   19%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          72 out of     288   25%
    Number of unique control sets:               8
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of  93,120    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
